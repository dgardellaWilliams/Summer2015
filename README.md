# Summer 2015 Work
This is a repository of the all work I did over the summer.

In the notes directory, you will find a few writeups of my thoughts on the animation and how to preceed, as well as a writeup of the steps taken to setup a newly configured raspberry pi. 
Go here if you have any questions about how to install things or how to debug common problems.

In the graphics directory, you will find my code for running the animation designed by Sarah Abramson.
The animation can be compiled with "make".
An example configuration file is included to aid in the process.
The readers folder contained in here has the drivers for each device. 

In the dev directory, you will find some of the code that has been developed, but has not been accepted.
